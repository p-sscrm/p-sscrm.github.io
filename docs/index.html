<p>The Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework (P-SSCRM) described here is designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding and analyzing real world data from nine industry leading software supply chain risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain risk management program and determining where your organization’s existing efforts stand when contrasted with other real world software supply chain risk management initiatives.
<br />
<br />
The table below shows the structure of the P-SSCRM
Framework. It includes four broad groups of Governance, Product, Environment, and Deployment.
Our practice and control descriptions, provide a common vocabulary for
explaining the salient elements of an Software Supply Chain Risk Management Initiative (SSCRM-I). Within the four P-SSCRM groups are 15 practices
(e.g., Perform compliance). The current version of the P-SSCRM is composed of 75 software supply chain risk management controls that are organized into these 15 practices.

The P-SSCRM Framework is the result of a study of real-world software supply chain risk management initiatives and the union of the
controls in ten government and industry documents (standards and frameworks). Controls in the P-SSCRM
are mapped to one or more of these standards and frameworks. We present the model as built
directly from these controls and from data observed in real-world software supply chain risk
management initiatives from a diverse and global collection of firms through data collected in 2022
and 2023. We have conducted interviews based on P-SSCRM at nine software development organizations, as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08083">[Williams, Miguez]</a>, which found that the organizations had implemented common security controls and were in the process of adopting controls to guard against the novel attack vectors introduced by software supply chain attacks.
