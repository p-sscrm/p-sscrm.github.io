<p>The Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework (P-SSCRM) described here is designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding and analyzing real world data from nine industry leading software supply chain risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain risk management program and determining where your organization’s existing efforts stand when contrasted with other real world software supply chain risk management initiatives.
<br />
<br />
The table below shows the structure of the Proactive Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM)
Framework. It includes four broad groups of Governance, Product, Environment, and Deployment.
Our P-SSCRM as well as both practice and task descriptions, provides a common vocabulary for
explaining the salient elements of an SSCRM Initiative. Within the four P-SSCRM groups are 15 practices
(e.g., Perform compliance). P-SSCRM, the P-SSCRM is composed of 74
software supply chain risk management tasks are organized into these 15 practices.

<h3 id="where-did-the-p_sscrm-come-from">WHERE DID THE P_SSCRM COME FROM?</h3>

<p>The Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework results from a
unique study of real-world software supply chain risk management initiatives and the union of the
tasks in ten government and industry documents (standards and frameworks). Tasks in the P-SSCRM
are mapped to one or more of these standards and frameworks. We present the model as built
directly from these tasks and from data observed in real-world software supply chain risk
management initiatives from a diverse and global collection of firms through data collected in 2022
and 2023.
